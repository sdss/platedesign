CS2 is the second version of scaling algorithm for minimum-cost
flow problems. For more detailed description, see "An
Efficient Implementation of a Scaling Minimum-Cost Flow Algorithm" by
A.V. Goldberg, Technical Report STAN-CS-92-1439, Computer Science
Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 1992.

The program is designed to run under BSD UNIX.
The program reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
output. Edit makefile to set desirable compiler options.
Then run "make" to compile the program. Program name is "cs2".

Parameters: If no parameters are given, default values are used.
There is one optional parameter, scale factor, which must be an integer.
The default value if SCALE_DEFAULT. Changing this parameter may
affect performance.

CS2 was developed by Andrew Goldberg (avg@research.nj.nec.com) and
Boris Cherkassky (cher@cher.msk.su).

The program is available on "as is" basis. It is not guaranteed to
be free of bugs, and the authors assume no responsibility for any
potential problems.
