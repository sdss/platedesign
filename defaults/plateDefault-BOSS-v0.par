# XXX we need to make plugfile_plplugmap_boss.pro
#     we want MAG to correspond to FIBER2FLUX, correct?
#     we need bosstile to generate the TARGETTYPE and SOURCETYPE
#     do the ops folks anticipate plPlugMapP changes?
# XXX we need to write fiberid_boss
#     for that, we need at least approximate positions of cartridges

# Types of targets to guarantee a certain number of.
# At least one type required.  Names are free-form, but

# Number of pointings, and number of offsets per pointing
# A pointing involves closing the shutter and reacquisition.
# An offset is a small offset (arcminutish) during an exposure.
# "nOffsets 0" means we don't move during the exposure.
# If there is an offset, it must be the same for all exposures.

nOffsets 0

# For each instrument, you must specify how many 
# targets of each type are wanted. This is an array 
# for multi-pointing or offset plates, of the form
#  p1/o0 p2/o0 pM/o0 ... p1/oN ... pM/oN
# (for M pointings and N offsets).
