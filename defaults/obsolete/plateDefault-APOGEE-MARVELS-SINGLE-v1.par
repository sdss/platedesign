# Number of pointings, and number of offsets per pointing
# A pointing involves closing the shutter and reacquisition.
# An offset is a small offset (arcminutish) during an exposure.
# "nOffsets 0" means we don't move during the exposure.
# If there is an offset, it must be the same for all exposures.
